This will then allow BIS to define the offer and approach fully and consider if you wish to bring back for a formal exemption at that point.  CAMPAIGN SITE Review March 15: 9/2/15 - Informed by PF that AGREED to be EXEMPT as the campaign is due to end March 2015 - the .gov.uk domain to be retired as part of campaign end and all content to be rationalised to the exempt apprenticeships.org.uk. The decision for the site to remain separate to GOV.UK is due to timeline and resource required to move would not be an effective use of department / GDS resource. 3/9/14 - Informed by G.Noyce that the .gov.uk site is a newly opened (20 August) campaign site that supports the current BIS campaign promoting apprenticeships. The URL is an old microsite that used to direct to the .org site. He was informed that the campaign was included in BIS’s ERG Marketing Freeze exemption request, and was discussed with GDS prior to sending to ERG (apbossly James Thornett and Roo Reynolds). The budget runs to the end of March 2015, at which stage BIS will need to bid for further funding. Beccy Russell will obtain more info. Is site strictly a campaign site?29/8/14 - Notified about site by Sam Helliar. URL has been owned since 2004 but has been resurrected as a website recently and has a different look and feel to http://www.apprenticeships.org.uk. Queried with Graham Noyce. SFA owned.

It breaches the gov.uk guidance, but is an exemptional case and has been agreed by James T and Neil Williams as the best solution. 15/4/15 - GN informed that Terraquest formally took over the running on 11 March 2015  and have formed a new company called PortalPlanQuest in which DCLG retain a small share (10% or less). CLG will fund the current site for 6 months during which PortalPlanQuest will build a replacement site on the planningportal.co.uk domain – once this is launched the old site will close. So it is expected that the .gov.uk site will close in August 2015. \n30/3/15 - Informed by PF that on 26 Mar 2015, it was announced that a Joint venture was established to run the Planning Portal: DCLG has entered into a joint venture with TerraQuest Limited, setting up a new company to run the Planning Portal: http://www.wired-gov.net/wg/news.nsf/articles/DNWA-9UYDWR. Pplanningportal.gov.uk will cease to exist as a domain after the 'commercialised' site goes live, around August 15. The new commercialised site will not take a .gov.uk domain.

He stated that the website was originally classified as a campaign site, but no longer qualifies as a campaign. ONS will shortly make a decision on Tech City’s status. The DEU is keen for it to be classified as a non-government body. All discussion about transition/exemption was put on hold until the ONS decision. I have riteen to Andrew Simpson and V.Hambrook Skinner to query. 14/4/15 - Fran Lopez, outstanding question on whether TechCity is a public sector site. Needs clarification soon.

Part of the solution they came up with, working with English Heritage and The War Memorials Trust was a single portal (merging existing ones) where the public and organisations can ensure their memorial is properly registered and and cared for and also research individual names of those remembered. IWM, as a heritage body, is out of scope of the central advertising and marketing controls. 9/2/15 - Discovered site which PF will be addressing with DCMS as there is no spend approval for this and there are other sites out that already gather this data.",

The intention is that this trust-type body will operate independently of Government and should require its own website outside gov.uk. However, this move has not yet been confirmed by Ministers and there is no legislation imminent. The future of what is left of the organisation is yet to be decided and until there is confirmation of intent and timescales, and details of status under the new arrangements, it will remain exempt from the gov.uk process.

While they are listed as public bodies and report annually to Parliament, there is no direct control over their operational activities by Defra. I don’t believe we (Defra) have ever committed to close this website, nor do we have the authority to tell Seafish to do so. As confirmed by a DL paper on 23/1/13, this site is exempt from GOV.UK. 22/10/13 - Notified by Daniel Decruz that this is a Levy board as part of the sea fish authority and has been marked as such.
